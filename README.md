# Codebusters

Codebusters is a Science Olympiad event in which teams will cryptanalyze and decode encrypted messages using cryptanalysis techniques for historical and modern advanced ciphers. 

This github repo aims to introduce different ciphers, some strategies to solve the problems, step-by-step solutions to some examples, and use python programs to illustrate them. 

The guides are composed with jupyter notebook. You may read it simply from the github website. If you would like to play with the Python routines, you may clone the repo to your local machine and run them under jupyter-notebook. For example, you may install Python and jupyter-notebook via [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/4.3.0/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/jupyter/).
