# Codebusters



Codebusters is a Science Olympiad event in which teams will cryptanalyze and decode encrypted messages using cryptanalysis techniques for historical and modern advanced ciphers. 

This github repo aims to introduce different ciphers, some strategies to solve the problems, and use python programs to illustrate them. You may play with the python program by clone the repo to your local machine and running under jupyter-notebook.
