    "\n",
    "Ciphers with mono-alphabetic substitution use a cipher table where each letter in plain text is replaced by a different letter in cipher text; the letters have one-to-one correspondence. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a cipher table generated randomly,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Plain:   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n",
    "Cipher:  JMNBOEZRGWXPQCYKSTFDALVIUH\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and a plain text \"Codebuster is fun!\" can be encrypted as, with 'C'->'N', 'o'->'y' and so,  \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Plaintext:   Codebuster is fun!\n",
    "Ciphertext:  Nybomafdot gf eac!\n",
    "```\n",

    "With a decipher table, which is the inverse of the cipher table, \n",

    "Plain:   UDNTFSIZXAPVBCELMHQRYWJKOG\n",

    "the decryption can be easily done, following the same alphabetic substitution procedure, with 'N'->'C', 'y'->'o', and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the decipher table is not provided in most cases, which is your task to find out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mono-alphabetic ciphers may contain spaces (Aristocrats) or may have spaces removed (Patristocrats). Mono-alphabetic ciphers may use K1, K2, or random alphabets as defined by the ACA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fully random alaphbets are difficult to decipher. Usually, some hints or keywords are provided. For example, in K1, K2, a keyword is provided in the cipher/decipher table, located randomly, while the rest letters follow the Caesar Cipher (with a shift). \n",

    "#### Identify The Smallest Words First\n",
