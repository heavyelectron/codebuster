    "When solving a question encoded with the Baconian Cipher, it is very likely that they won't explicitly give you \"A\" and \"B\" to use to find the corresponding letters. Most of the time, they'll have certain symbols or letters that are meant to represent \"A\" and \"B\". One example of this would be using all of of the even letters in the alphabet to represent \"A\" while all the odd letters represent \"B\". There are many different variants of this, including symbols on a keyboard and vowel/consonants. To solve a Baconian, try to group the different symbols/letters into two groups based on their properties, and assign one group \"A\" and the other group \"B\". If it doesn't work the first time, then switch the groups so that the previous \"A\" group is now the \"B\" group. If even then it doesn't seem to be working, then start over again and find a different characteristic to base the groups off of. For this reason, the Baconian Cipher can take longer than some of the other ciphers.\n",
