    "At the invitational/Regional level, one cryptogram may be in Spanish as a challenge. At the state level, there will be at least one. It may be helpful if one of the partners is fluent in or has a few years of knowledge in Spanish.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Spanish cryptograms, n and ñ are treated as different letters. However, letters with accents are treated the same as without (a and á are the same). This means that, when working with cryptograms, accent marks do not factor in. Also, ch, ll, and rr are NOT considered distinct letters. Thus, \"churro\" would have 6 letters: c-h-u-r-r-o. Therefore, the Spanish alphabet used for cryptograms is English alphabet plus ñ. \n",

    "* Look for the two most common letters, instead of the most common letters: E and A have relatively close frequency, and are much higher than the rest.\n",
    "* The most common spanish words are DE, LA, QUE, EL, EN. Since Spanish has far more two-letter words, it is helpful to decrypt them, using the placement of the letter E. QUE is the most common three-letter word, almost twice as common as the next ones.\n",
