    "There are some examples at the Python Utilities section below. The Hill Cipher is not so difficult as long as you are familiar with linear algebra, and modular arithmetic. It just takes a long time to do all the calculations. I will not go through the detailed steps of the encyption/decryption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part is to compute the modular multiplicative inverse matrix. You are required to do it when e.g., being asked to decrypt a message but the encryption matrix is given; to encrypt a message but the decryption key is given. You may follow the standard procedure by calculating its determinant and its adjugate matrix. Or, I have found that the Gaussian elimination procedure is easier and faster. See [Modular Inversion](../Modular/Readme.ipynb) for instructions and examples, where step-by-step instructions are provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a Hill Cipher problem in Codebusters, either the encryption or the decryption key has to be provided. Otherwise, decrypting the ciphertext is not human solvable. With computers, one might be able to search the key space for small matrices, e.g., 2x2, there are at most $26^4$ keys. Note that not all matrices serve as Hill Cipher keys; it needs to be modular invertible, or its determinant needs to be coprime with 26. This limits the key space. \n",
